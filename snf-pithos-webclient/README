snf-pithos-webclient
********************

This is the python package of the pithos frontend web application. It consists
of a django application module which includes a prebuilt version of the pithos
gwt project contained in `../src` directory.

The gwt build files are not included in the repository. Ant hooks has been
added in setup.py so that each time you run ``python setup.py {develop,
install, sdist}`` ant build gets executed automatically for you.  Additionally
after each successfull build, compiled js and other asset files are copied in
the appropriate locations so that they will get included in the created python
package.
